import pandas as pd

# It's more conventional to import pandas as 'pd', not 'np'.
# 'np' is typically used for NumPy.

d = pd.read_csv('Data.csv')

# To display the DataFrame, you can simply call its variable name in an interactive environment
# like a Jupyter Notebook or a Python console.
# In a script, you might want to use print(d.head()) or print(d.info())
# to see a summary of the data.
print(d)
